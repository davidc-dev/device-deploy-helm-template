1) If using Azure Workload Identity:
   - Ensure your ServiceAccount has the correct annotations (client-id / federated credential).
   - The cluster must have Secrets Store CSI + AKV provider installed.

2) If using Service Principal:
   - Create a Secret with the client secret, and set values under akv.auth.servicePrincipal.
   - Inject env vars in your workload as required by your cluster’s AKV provider configuration.

3) NFS PV is disabled by default. If you enable it, confirm you have cluster privileges and SCC/SCRs allow NFS.

4) If Route is enabled, access the app via the generated host or set values.route.host.
